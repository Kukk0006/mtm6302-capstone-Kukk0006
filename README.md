Intended Project -Astronomy Picture of the Day Search

I went for more of an App feel rather than a static website.  There will be interactive elements, the main ones are using the telescope to access the picture of the day.  There will be options to view the picture without the overlay, as well as learning more.  The favorites button will be on all 3 of the screens.  Clicking on the books will access the favorites or the past pictures of the day.  I will be using Turn.Js to create the book effect, it adds animation that looks like page turns.  The favorites will look like a photo album with two pictures per page.  On the bottom left of each picture will open the choice to read more or delete the favorite.  The past pictures will have one picture per pages, and provide the additional information about each by default.  The first page will allow the user to jump to a specific date.  I chose a drop down menu, so there isn't a conflict with the date format.  The past pictures also have the option to favorite the image.

The fonts I chose is Exo for the main font.  It is clean and easy to read, but gives a sci-fi feel to it.  Consolas is the "header" font used on the title pages of the books.

I plan on making the books and telescope grow on hover for the desktop, maybe add a bit of a dropshadow that acts like a glow, and for tablet/mobile since there is no hover, it would be an animation on page load, then on click there will be the grow with a delay in the activation of the button.

All the assets minus the pictures from the APOD site are going to have a cartoon/hand drawn affect.  It will give a hand crafted, cute/whimiscal feel to the site overall.
